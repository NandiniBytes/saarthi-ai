## üöÄ The Mission: Bridging Human Intent and Machine Execution

Geospatial analysis is powerful, but it's also a bottleneck. A simple question like *"Show me areas in Gujarat vulnerable to flooding"* can trigger hours of work for a human expert involving data sourcing, tool selection, complex processing, and error handling.

**Saarthi AI** was born to solve this. It's not just a tool; it's an intelligent partner. Named after the Sanskrit word for "charioteer" (‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡§•‡§ø), Saarthi doesn't just execute commands‚Äîit understands the goal, plans the journey, and expertly guides the tools (the "horses") to the destination, navigating obstacles along the way.

## ‚ú® Core Features

Saarthi is built on a foundation of cutting-edge AI techniques to emulate the workflow of a seasoned GIS analyst.

* **üß† Natural Language Reasoning:** Ask complex questions in plain English. Saarthi decomposes your high-level goal into a logical sequence of actions.
* **üìù Transparent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Planning:** Watch Saarthi "think" in real-time. The UI displays its step-by-step plan, providing complete transparency into its reasoning process.
* **üõ†Ô∏è RAG-Powered Tool Mastery:** Saarthi uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to consult a knowledge base of GIS tool documentation (GDAL), ensuring it generates accurate, executable code every time.
* **üîÑ Robust Self-Correction Loop:** This is Saarthi's superpower. When real-world data issues cause an error (like a CRS mismatch), Saarthi doesn't crash. It analyzes the error, formulates a new plan to fix it (e.g., "I will reproject the layer"), and re-attempts the task.
* **üåê Multi-Source Data Integration:** Seamlessly orchestrates data access from sources like ISRO's Bhuvanidhi portal and OpenStreetMap.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture: The Robust Orchestrator

Saarthi is implemented as a stateful, cyclical graph using LangGraph. This architecture treats failure not as an endpoint, but as a state, enabling true resilience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started: Running Saarthi Locally

This setup uses a local Python virtual environment.

**Prerequisites:**
* Python 3.11+
* Git
* **GDAL installed on your system.** (This is crucial. The easiest way on Windows is via the [OSGeo4W installer](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/osgeo4w/)).

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/NandiniBytes/saarthi-ai.git](https://github.com/NandiniBytes/saarthi-ai.git)
cd saarthi-ai
```

**2. Set Up the Backend Environment:**
Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd saarthi-backend
```
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Create your Environment File:**
Create a file named `.env` inside the `saarthi-backend` directory and add your Groq API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key-here"
```

**5. Build the Knowledge Base:**
The agent needs a vector store of tool documentation. Run the build script once:
```bash
python knowledge_base/build_kb.py
```

**6. Run the Backend Server:**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The backend will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

**7. Connect via ngrok (Optional for live testing):**
To connect your deployed frontend to your local backend, open a new terminal and run:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```
Use the generated forwarding URL in your frontend's API calls.

## üî≠ Future Roadmap

The Robust Orchestrator is a powerful foundation. Future versions of Saarthi will explore even more advanced agentic architectures:

* **Hierarchical Multi-Agent System:** A "team" of specialized agents (e.g., a DataScout, a GIS-Processor) managed by a central orchestrator.
* **Proactive MCTS Planner:** Using Monte Carlo Tree Search to explore multiple solution paths and proactively choose the most efficient one.
* **Self-Improving Agent:** An agent that learns from its successes, adding completed workflows back into its knowledge base to solve similar problems faster in the future.
