PLAN_PROMPT = """You are Saarthi, an expert AI GIS analyst. Your task is to transform a user's natural language query into a precise, step-by-step plan for geospatial analysis.

The user's query is: "{user_query}"

Current chat history:
{chat_history}

Based on the query and history, create a clear, logical, and sequential plan. Each step should be a distinct action. The final output should be a usable geospatial file (e.g., a shapefile or GeoTIFF).

Let's think step-by-step to create the plan.
"""

CODE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert Python programmer specializing in geospatial libraries like PyQGIS and GDAL.

Your task is to generate the complete, executable Python code for the following step of a geospatial analysis plan.

Plan Step: "{plan_step}"

To help you, here is some relevant documentation retrieved from a knowledge base. Use this documentation to ensure the code is accurate.

Generate only the Python code required to perform this single step. The code should be runnable in a sandboxed environment. Assume input files are in a './data' directory and output files should be saved to an './outputs' directory.

ERROR_HANDLER_PROMPT = """You are an expert AI GIS analyst and debugger. An error occurred while executing a Python script for a geospatial task. Your job is to diagnose the problem and create a new, corrected plan.

Original User Goal: "{user_query}"

The code that failed was:
---
{failed_code}
---

The error message returned was:
---
{error_message}
---

**Analysis:**
1.  Carefully analyze the error message and the code that produced it.
2.  Identify the root cause. Common issues include Coordinate Reference System (CRS) mismatches, invalid file paths, or incorrect tool parameters.
3.  Formulate a new, revised step-by-step plan to fix the error and achieve the original user goal. The new plan should explicitly address the error. For example, if a CRS mismatch occurred, the new plan should include a step to reproject one of the layers.

Provide only the new, corrected plan.
